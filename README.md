## 💭 Interesting Piece of Code

>One interesting piece of code that I want to highlight is the cost validation. In the screenshot it runs a while loop to check for a valid input type being a double in the next line. If it fails the pass it's then run back with another scanner to check again and once it detects that there is a double it then takes that line and reformats it into a string to then convert it into a .00 decimal format for handling money.
